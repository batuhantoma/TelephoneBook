# TelephoneBook


Phone Book Application

React is used on the frontend. Crud process is provided with Axios.
The requests from the front were answered by writing the web api with .Net Core 3 on the back.
MongoDB has been used as the database and the necessary report result is taken from here.

Kafka technology is used in this structure.
While writing the report of users in the phone book, consumer and producer in another service worked.

The data that is in "Preparing" status is listened with this structure and done "Completed" in mongoDB.
